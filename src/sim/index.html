        This is the final iteration of my EngD Model.

        <p>The model reads a number of GIS shapefiles and displays a road network, two
        Environment Agency flood maps and a bespoke Open Source Vulnerability Index
        (OSVI). The model reads in a .CSV and generates a predetermined number of agents
        with set characteristics. The agents are placed on the road network and are
        located at a Red Cross office. The model reads a separate .CSV and assigns goal
        locations to each agent at random from a predetermined list. The agents are
        assigned speeds at random. Once the model is started, the agents move from
        A to B, then they change direction and head back to their start position.
        The process repeats until the user quits.
